## Introduction
Welcome to the Maidstone Hackspace Micromouse Github repository! This repository is dedicated to our Line Following Micromouse project, an exciting endeavor that combines robotics, programming, and problem-solving skills. Whether you're experienced or just starting out, you'll find valuable resources here to get involved in this exciting project.

A micromouse is a small autonomous robot that navigates a maze. The goal of this project is to design, build, and program the neccessary components for a Line Following Micromouse Competition.
